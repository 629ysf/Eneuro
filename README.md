Neurodynamics of awareness detection in immigrants at high altitudes 
The file contained behavioral data, EEG data and their codes to analyze them

Data:
In the behavioral data (exp.txt), subj_id represents the number of the subject, rt represents the response of the 
corresponding conscious detection of the subject, angle represents the tilt Angle of the target stimulus, 
and response represents the choice (1, left; 2, right).
These three EEG data (1_cleandata.mat; 3_cleandata.mat; 4_cleandata.mat) are clean data that have been 
preprocessed. If you need other data, you can send email to me.

Code:
The HDDM code from the site-https://hddm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/  was ran by the jupyter notebook (
a web-based application of Python3 for interactive computing)
The other three txt files are event-related potentials analysis, time-frequency analysis, and permutation test 
analysis for the EEG data.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the data operation. My email is mscnuysf@163.com.
